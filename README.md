This here is an example distributed app using Cloud Haskell.

I wrote a blog post about this at [yager.io/Distributed/Distributed.html](https://yager.io/Distributed/Distributed.html).

To install dependencies, run `cabal install --only-dependencies`. You can also just `cabal install` each dependency yourself if there's a newer version.

To compile, run `ghc Distributed.hs`.
